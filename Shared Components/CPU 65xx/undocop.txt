6502 Undocumented Opcodes
==========================


Based on the Atari 8-bit 6502

Version 3.0, 5/17/1997

By Freddy Offenga (offen300@hio.tem.nhl.nl)


This version is a direct follow up of the illegal opcode list by Joakim
Atterhal (WosFilm) and me which was published in the Atari 8-bit disk
magazine "Mega Magazine" issue #6. Most opcode names in this list
originated from a disassembler for the Atari (The Symbolic
Disassembler by HiasSoft).

Changes since Version 2.0:

Version 2.0 was compared with two Commodore 8-bit based lists found on
the internet. There were some differences in opcode names, so I
included the other names too. Names between curly brackets are the names
taken from the list compiled by Craig Taylor. Names between square
brackets are the names taken from the list by Adam Vardy.

The old list was also compared with two other Atari 8-bit based lists
(by Frank Leiprecht and Peter Wötzel). No new things were found on these
lists.

The timing values (clock cycles) from all the opcodes were compared with
the values on the list by Adam Vardy. There were no differences.

The addressing modes for the "DOP" (double nop) and "TOP" instructions
were copied from Craig Taylor's list. The reason for this is that the
different addressing modes explain the differences in the timing values.

Opcode $8B was removed from the "AAX" table. The behaviour of this
opcode seems to be comlex (as noted by several people). Maybe there
will be more information in the next version of this document. For now
this opcode is called "XAA".

The addressing mode for opcode $A3 (LAX) was false on the previous list.
Changed to (indirect,x).

The addressing modes for opcodes $13 and $03 (SLO) were switched.
Corrected in this version.

Addressing mode for opcode $B7 (LAX) was "zero-page,x", but should be
"zero-page,y". Corrected.

Changed the suspicious opcode $93. This one was called "DOP", but is in
fact another "AXA" instruction.

Tested the behaviour of $9E (SXA), $9C (SYA) and $9B (XAS). There static
AND with 7 mentioned in the old list was false. The observation of the
function 'AND with the high byte of the argument + 1' (from Adam Vardy's
list) seems to be correct.
